# SIUE Campus Routing Algorithm Visualizer

**Author:** Odedairo Oluwaferanmi
**Institution:** Southern Illinois University Edwardsville

A full-stack web application for visualizing and comparing shortest path algorithms on the SIUE campus map.

## 🎯 Project Goal

Create and compare 3 different algorithms to find the shortest path between buildings on the SIUE campus, with:
- Buildings as nodes
- Walkways/paths as weighted edges (distance in meters)
- Interactive visualization to understand how each algorithm works

## 🧮 Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **Type:** Greedy
- **Time Complexity:** O((V + E) log V)
- **Approach:** Always expands the nearest unvisited node
- **Best for:** General shortest path with non-negative weights

### 2. A* Search Algorithm
- **Type:** Heuristic-guided
- **Time Complexity:** O((V + E) log V) - often faster in practice
- **Approach:** Uses Euclidean distance to guide search toward goal
- **Best for:** Point-to-point pathfinding on spatial graphs

### 3. Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- **Type:** Dynamic Programming
- **Time Complexity:** O(V × E)
- **Approach:** Relaxes all edges V-1 times
- **Best for:** Graphs with negative weights (demonstrates different approach)

## 🗺️ Campus Graph

Based on the official SIUE Campus Core Map:
- **50+ locations** including academic buildings, residence halls, parking lots
- **70+ paths** connecting locations with distance weights
- Building coordinates mapped for accurate visualization

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Backend (Python)
- **FastAPI** - Modern async web framework
- **Pydantic** - Data validation
- Custom algorithm implementations with step-by-step tracking

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Framer Motion** - Animations
- SVG-based interactive campus map

## 🔌 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/graph` | GET | Get campus nodes and edges |
| `/api/buildings` | GET | List all buildings |
| `/api/algorithms` | GET | Algorithm information |
| `/api/path` | POST | Find path with one algorithm |
| `/api/compare` | POST | Compare all three algorithms |

### Example Request
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/path \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "start": "8",
    "end": "19",
    "algorithm": "dijkstra"
  }'
```

### Example Response
```json
{
  "algorithm": "Dijkstra",
  "path": ["8", "A", "5", "7", "E", "11", "19"],
  "pathNames": ["Morris University Center", "Parking Lot A", ...],
  "totalDistance": 523.4,
  "executionTimeMs": 0.234,
  "nodesVisited": 15,
  "edgesRelaxed": 42,
  "success": true,
  "steps": [...]
}
```

## 📈 Algorithm Comparison Results

For a typical route (MUC to Engineering Building):

| Metric | Dijkstra | A* | Bellman-Ford |
|--------|----------|-----|--------------|
| Distance | 523.4m | 523.4m | 523.4m |
| Nodes Visited | 15 | 8 | 50 |
| Execution Time | 0.23ms | 0.18ms | 1.45ms |

**Key Insights:**
- All algorithms find the same optimal path (correctness ✓)
- A* visits fewer nodes due to heuristic guidance
- Bellman-Ford is slowest due to O(V×E) complexity

## 🏫 Campus Buildings Included

**Academic:** Rendleman Hall, Founders Hall, Alumni Hall, Peck Hall, Lovejoy Library, Dunham Hall, Science Buildings, Morris University Center (MUC), Art & Design, Engineering Building, and more

**Residential:** Woodland Hall, Prairie Hall, Bluff Hall, Evergreen Hall
